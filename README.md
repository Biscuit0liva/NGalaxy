# NGalaxy
N-body problem simulation, using the collision betwen the galaxys Andromeda and the Milky Way. Based on the proyect https://www.evl.uic.edu/sjames/cs525/project2.html

This project was developed in window 11 OS and Ubuntu .
## Requirements
- glad
- glfw
- CUDA
- openCL
- CMake 3.24+
## Execution

At the project root, compile with CMake specifying whether to use CUDA (default) or OpenCL.
To do so, run the same commands twice, changing the value of **USE_OPENCL**

### For CUDA (default)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_OPENCL=OFF
cmake --build build 
```
### For OpenCL

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_OPENCL=ON
cmake --build build 
```
For the execution, the path changes.
### For CUDA
```bash
./build/cuda/galaxy_cuda.exe
```
### For OpenCL
```bash
./build/opencl/galaxy_opencl.exe
```

### Note for hybrid GPU systems (Intel + NVIDIA)

On machines with both an integrated Intel GPU and a discrete NVIDIA GPU (Optimus systems), the OpenGL context may default to the Intel GPU, while CUDA runs on the NVIDIA GPU. To enable CUDAâ€“OpenGL interoperability (e.g., cudaGraphicsMapResources), you must force the application to use the NVIDIA GPU. For example:
```bash
prime-run ./build/.../galaxy.exe
```
If prime-run is not available, you can achieve the same effect by using environment variables:
```bash
__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 \
__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia \
prime-run ./build/.../galaxy.exe
```

On systems with a single dedicated NVIDIA GPU, no special steps are required.

## TODO

- openCL version

- Experiments
- ### CUDA
  - [ ] Odd vs Even block size value
  - [ ] 2D array vs 1D
  - [ ] Local Memory vs No local memory

- ### openCL
  - [ ] 32 multiple vs no multiple block size value
  - [ ] 2D array vs 1D
  - [ ] Local Memory vs No local memory
